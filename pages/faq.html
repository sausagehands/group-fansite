    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <details>
        <summary><b>What exactly is a sloth?</b></summary>
        <p>Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America.
            They belong to two main families — two-toed and three-toed sloths —
            named for the number of claws on their front limbs.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Why do sloths move so slowly?</b></summary>
        <p>
            Their slow movement is a survival strategy.
            It helps them conserve energy (since their diet is low-calorie leaves)
            and avoid predators by blending into the trees.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>How long do sloths live?</b></summary>
        <p>In the wild, sloths live about 20–30 years.
            In captivity, with fewer predators and regular meals,
            some can live into their 40s.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Do sloths really sleep all day?</b></summary>
        <p>Not quite! Wild sloths sleep around 10 hours a day —
            less than the old myth of “20 hours.”
            The rest of the time they’re quietly munching leaves or hanging out (literally).
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>How often do sloths come down from the trees?</b></summary>
        <p>Only about once a week, usually to poop!
            The rest of their lives — eating, sleeping, even giving birth —
            happens in the trees.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>What do sloths eat?</b></summary>
        <p>
            Mostly leaves, twigs, and fruit. They’re strict folivores (leaf-eaters),
            and their slow metabolism means they don’t need much food.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Are sloths good swimmers?</b></summary>
        <p>
            Surprisingly, yes! They can swim three times faster than they move on land,
            using a kind of doggy paddle and holding their breath for up to 40 minutes.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Do sloths have any predators?</b></summary>
        <p>
            Yes — jaguars, ocelots, harpy eagles, and large snakes like anacondas.
            Their best defense is staying motionless and camouflaged.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Why do sloths have green fur sometimes?</b></summary>
        <p>
            That green tint comes from algae growing on their fur.
            The algae help them blend in, and sloths even absorb nutrients from it through their skin.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Are sloths endangered?</b></summary>
        <p>
            Some species are. The Pygmy three-toed sloth,
            found only on a tiny island off Panama, is critically endangered.
            Habitat loss and deforestation are major threats.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>Do sloths ever touch the ground?</b></summary>
        <p>
            Rarely. When they do, it’s awkward — they can’t walk well and have to drag themselves.
            They’re built for hanging, not hiking!
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><b>What’s the difference between two-toed and three-toed sloths?</b></summary>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two-toed sloths:
                Slightly larger, nocturnal, and faster (relatively speaking).
            </li>
            <li>
                Three-toed sloths:
                Smaller, diurnal (active by day), and have that iconic “smiling” face.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
