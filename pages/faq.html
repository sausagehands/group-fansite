                    <h3>What exactly is a sloth?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America.
                    There are two main types — two-toed and three-toed sloths — named for the number of claws
                    on their front limbs.

                    <h3>How long do sloths live?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Wild sloths live around 20–30 years, but in captivity they can reach their 40s.

                <summary class="faq-question">
                    <h3>What’s the difference between two-toed and three-toed sloths?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Two-toed sloths are larger, nocturnal, and slightly faster.
                    Three-toed sloths are smaller, active in the daytime, and have the signature “smiling” face.

                    <h3>Why do sloths move so slowly?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Their slow movement conserves energy and helps them stay hidden from predators.
                    Their leaf-based diet provides very little energy, so they move only when necessary.
                </p>

                    <h3>Do sloths really sleep all day?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Wild sloths sleep about 10 hours a day, not the rumored 20. The rest of the time,
                    they’re quietly eating or hanging from branches.
                </p>

                    <h3>How often do sloths come down from the trees?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Only about once a week — usually to poop. The rest of their lives happen in the
                    trees.</p>

                    <h3>Do sloths ever touch the ground?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Rarely. When they do, they move awkwardly by dragging themselves since their
                    bodies are
                    built for hanging, not walking.

                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Baby sloths cling to their mothers for months, watching and mimicking her
                    movements until
                    they can climb independently.

                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">They’re folivores — meaning they eat mostly leaves, twigs, and fruit. Their slow
                    metabolism
                    means they need very little food.

                    <h3>Why is their digestion so slow?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Their multi-chambered stomachs break down tough plant material very slowly.
                    It can take up to a month to digest one meal.

                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">They rarely drink directly; instead, they absorb moisture from the leaves and
                    morning dew
                    they eat.

                    <h3>Why do sloths have green fur sometimes?</h3>
                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Algae and fungi grow on their fur, giving them a greenish tint that helps
                    camouflage them.
                    These organisms even form a tiny ecosystem unique to sloths.

                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Sloths can swim three times faster than they move on land and hold their
                    breath for
                    up to 40 minutes.

                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Their best defense is staying still and blending in. Camouflage and silence keep
                    them safe
                    from predators like jaguars and harpy eagles.

                <p class="faq-answer">Some species are. The Pygmy three-toed sloth, found only on a small Panamanian
                    island,
                    is critically endangered due to habitat loss.

                </summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">No — sloths are wild animals that need specific diets and climates.
                    They become easily stressed and unhealthy in captivity.

                    catch a sloth if it moves too much.
