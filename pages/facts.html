    <h2>Top 5 Cool Sloth Facts</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>They are shockingly good swimmers:</strong>
        Even though sloths are slow on land, they’re three times faster in 
        water. They use a kind of gentle breaststroke and can hold their breath
        for up to <em>40 minutes</em> by slowing their metabolism.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>They have a whole ecosystem living in their fur:</strong>
        Sloth fur hosts algae, beetles, fungi, and moths—some of which live 
        <em>only</em> on sloths. The algae tint their fur green for camouflage, 
        and in return, the sloth gets nutrients when grooming. It’s like a tiny 
        moving rainforest!
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Their digestion is ridiculously slow:</strong>
        It can take a sloth <em>7–30 days</em> to digest a single leaf. Because 
        of this slow process, up to one-third of their body weight can be made 
        up of food sitting in their stomach.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>They only poop once a week—and it’s dangerous:</strong>
        Sloths climb down from their trees to poop, which makes them vulnerable 
        to predators. Scientists call it a “poop run,” though it’s more like a 
        slow shuffle. No one knows exactly why they risk it, but it might help 
        maintain their fur ecosystem.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>They have extra neck vertebrae:</strong>
        Most mammals have seven neck vertebrae—sloths can have <em>eight or 
        nine</em>. This lets them rotate their heads up to <em>270°</em>, 
        owl-style, so they can watch for predators without moving their bodies.
