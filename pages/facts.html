  🐾 1. They are shockingly good swimmers

  Even though sloths are slow on land, they’re three times faster in water. They use a kind of gentle breaststroke and can hold their breath for up to 40 minutes by slowing their metabolism.

  🌿 2. They have a whole ecosystem living in their fur

  Sloth fur hosts algae, beetles, fungi, and moths—some of which live only on sloths. The algae help tint their fur green for camouflage, and in return the sloth gets some nutrients when grooming. A tiny moving rainforest!

  ⏳ 3. Their digestion is ridiculously slow

  It can take a sloth 7–30 days to digest a single leaf. Because of this slow process, up to ⅓ of their body weight can be made up of food in their stomach.

  🌳 4. They only poop once a week—and it’s dangerous

  Sloths climb down from their trees to poop, which makes them vulnerable to predators. Scientists call it a “poop run,” though it’s more of a slow shuffle. No one knows exactly why they risk it, but it might help maintain their fur ecosystem.

  🦴 5. They have extra neck vertebrae

Most mammals have 7 neck vertebrae—sloths can have 8 or 9. This lets them rotate their heads up to 270°, owl-style, which helps them watch for predators without moving their bodies.
